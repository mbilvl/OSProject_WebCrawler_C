# Short-term Hygiene Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the hygiene fixes that were completed for the C web crawler project.

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Fixed Header Globals (ODR Violations)
- **Issue**: Global variables were defined in header files causing multiple definition errors
- **Fix**: 
  - Created `state.c` to hold all global variable definitions
  - Changed definitions to `extern` declarations in headers
  - Updated Makefile to compile and link `state.c`
- **Files affected**: `hashqueue.h`, `crawler.h`, `state.c` (new), `Makefile`

### 2. Replaced Unsafe I/O Operations
- **Issue**: Use of unsafe functions like `scanf`, `strcpy`, unbounded `sscanf`
- **Fixes implemented**:
  - Replaced `scanf` with `fgets` + bounded `sscanf` for user input
  - Replaced `strcpy` with `strncpy` and proper null termination
  - Replaced string concatenation with `snprintf` for safer formatting
  - Added bounds to `sscanf` format specifiers (e.g., `%399[^/]`)
  - Removed unnecessary `sscanf` calls when processing file input
- **Files affected**: `bootup.c`, `queue.c`, `list.c`, `crawl_frontier.c`

### 3. Fixed Buffer Overflow in extract_root
- **Issue**: Writing to `tmp[7]` when array was only size 7
- **Fix**: Changed array size from 7 to 8 to accommodate null terminator
- **Files affected**: `bootup.c`

### 4. Fixed mkdir Octal Permissions
- **Issue**: Using decimal 777 instead of octal 0777, followed by unnecessary chmod
- **Fix**: Changed to use proper octal `0700` (rwx for user only) and removed redundant chmod
- **Files affected**: `bootup.c`

### 5. Implemented Safe Signal Handling
- **Issue**: Signal handlers performed unsafe operations (file I/O, malloc, etc.)
- **Fixes**:
  - Replaced direct file I/O in signal handler with a simple flag setting
  - Added `volatile sig_atomic_t should_checkpoint` flag
  - Implemented checkpoint checking in main spider loop
  - Removed handling of SIGSEGV and SIGABRT (let them crash for debugging)
- **Files affected**: `main.c`, `spider.c`, `state.c`, `crawler.h`

### 6. Improved CURL Usage
- **Issue**: Missing User-Agent, no redirect following, no timeouts, incomplete cleanup
- **Fixes added**:
  - User-Agent: "WebCrawler/1.0 (Educational Purpose)"
  - Follow redirects (CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION) with max 5 redirects
  - Connection timeout: 10 seconds
  - Total timeout: 30 seconds
  - Proper cleanup with `curl_easy_cleanup()` in all code paths
  - Added `tidyRelease()` for proper tidy cleanup
- **Files affected**: `spider.c`, `crawler.c`

### 7. Fixed Tidy Header Warning
- **Issue**: Using deprecated `buffio.h` header
- **Fix**: Changed to use `tidybuffio.h` instead
- **Files affected**: `crawler.h`

## Build and Test Status

The project now builds successfully with no errors and no warnings:
```bash
make clean && make
```

All hygiene fixes have been implemented and tested. The code is now more secure, robust, and follows better C programming practices.

## Remaining Considerations

While the short-term hygiene fixes are complete, the CRITICAL_REVIEW.md document mentions several other architectural issues that would require more substantial refactoring:
- Concurrency issues with multiple mutexes
- Memory leaks in various places
- Lack of robots.txt support
- No rate limiting or politeness features

These would require more extensive changes beyond the scope of short-term hygiene fixes.
